- ✅ Monorepo structure with npm workspaces + ESM modules
- ✅ TypeScript configured across all packages
- ✅ Core model types defined (Part, Device, SymbolDefinition, etc.)
- ✅ **CLI renamed to "fcad"** (fusionCad - better branding!)
- ✅ **Golden Circuit**: 3-wire motor starter (7 devices, 11 connections)
- ✅ **JSON Persistence**: Save/load circuits from JSON files
- ✅ **BOM Generator**: Exports CSV with parts grouped by manufacturer
- ✅ **Wire List Generator**: Exports CSV with all connections
- ✅ **3 Validation Rules**: Duplicate tags, unconnected devices, dead-end nets

  - ✅ Drag-select (marquee): Window select (left-to-right, fully enclosed) and Crossing select (right-to-left, any overlap)
- ✅ **Wire bend points**: Select wire, click to add waypoints, drag to adjust, double-click to delete
  - Orthogonal-only routing enforced (no diagonal wires)
  - Hit detection uses auto-routing for accurate clicks
- ✅ **Wire segment dragging**: Click-drag wire segments perpendicular to their direction
  - Horizontal segments drag up/down, vertical segments drag left/right
  - First/last segments auto-insert jog waypoints from pins

  - `SLOWMO=<ms>` env var for human-supervised runs
- ✅ **JSON-based Symbol Library** (55 IEC 60617 symbols):
  - Symbols loaded from `builtin-symbols.json` at startup
  - Each symbol has: id, name, category, svgPath, pins, tagPrefix
  - `loadSymbolsFromJson()` converts JSON to internal SymbolDefinition
  - Renderer uses `lookupSymbol()` (ID first, then category fallback)
- ✅ **Insert Symbol Dialog**:
  - Searchable modal for selecting symbols (replaces old sidebar palette)
  - Category filtering, symbol preview with SVG rendering
  - Symbol ID passed through for correct rendering and tag generation
- ✅ **Symbol Editor** (Visual Symbol Builder):
  - Drawing tools: Line, Rectangle, Circle, Polyline

  - 35 E2E tests passing

### What We're Working On
- ✅ ~~VISIBILITY BUG~~ — Fixed! RAF coalescing `needsRenderRef` was stuck at `true`
- ✅ Canvas panning — Hand tool (H), Space+drag, middle-click
- ✅ Selection UX — Marquee on click+drag (no Shift), group rotation (R key)
- ✅ HOA Linked Device Refactor — SS1 replaces HOA-H/HOA-A, uses placeLinkedDevice pattern
- ✅ **Storage architecture decided** — Free cloud tier for everyone (see below)
- ✅ **Cloud deployment ready** — Dockerfile, migrations, Railway config, CORS, health check
- ✅ **ERC hot-to-neutral short circuit** — Device classifier + circuit graph + BFS path analysis
- ✅ **Google/GitHub OAuth** — Amplify federated identity, OAuth buttons in AuthModal

### ✅ DECIDED: Free-Tier Storage Architecture (2026-02-27)

**Problem:** IndexedDB as primary storage for free-tier users has unacceptable failure modes:
- Clear browser data → projects gone
- Switch PC → projects not there
- Browser auto-cleanup (storage pressure) → could silently wipe data

**Decision: Option B — Free cloud tier for everyone.**

**Architecture:**
- **Unsigned users (sandbox mode):** Full editor works — draw, wire, place symbols, export. Data lives in IndexedDB as throwaway trial storage. No AI features. No persistence guarantee.
- **Signed-up users (free tier):** Cloud persistence via Postgres, auto-save, AI generation. Data survives across devices and browser clears.
- **Auth:** Keep existing Cognito + Amplify. Add Google/GitHub OAuth as federated identity providers for easy signup. Keep email/password as fallback.
- **IndexedDB migration:** Not needed — no real users have valuable local projects.
- **Free tier limits:** TBD (likely 3 projects, capped AI generations)

**Implementation phases:**
1. Add Google/GitHub OAuth to Cognito User Pool + UI buttons
2. Deploy cloud Postgres (Supabase/Neon free tier) + API (Railway/Fly.io)
3. Gate AI features behind auth (unsigned users can draw but not generate)
4. Later: org_id multi-tenancy, Stripe payments, team features

### Next Immediate Steps
1. **Deploy API to cloud** — Push Dockerfile to Railway/Fly.io, connect managed Postgres, set env vars
2. **Configure Cognito OAuth providers** — Add Google + GitHub in AWS Console, set VITE_COGNITO_OAUTH_DOMAIN
3. **Gate AI features behind auth** — Unsigned users can draw but not generate
4. Improve selector switch 3-pos symbol visuals (cam operator rendering at small sizes)
5. Implement IndexedDB sandbox for unsigned users (throwaway trial storage)

    - Red pin dots on symbols
    - Yellow pin labels (A1, A2, +, -, etc.)
  - Implemented orthogonal wire routing (90-degree angles)
  - Wires connect to actual pins (not device centers)
  - Fixed web app to load golden circuit on mount
  - Visual feedback loop working perfectly

**Progress**:
- Phase 1: ✅ 100% Complete
- Phase 2: 🟡 40% Complete (rendering done, need interactions)

**Next Session**:
- Add pan/zoom controls for navigation
- Improve symbol shapes (actual schematic symbols)
- Start symbol placement tool

**Blockers/Questions**:
- Wire routing needs improvement: multiple wires overlap at X1 terminal strip, creating visual ambiguity
- Need smarter routing algorithm to separate overlapping wire segments
- Simple staggering attempt caused chaos - needs different approach

**Session End Notes**:
- Canvas rendering fundamentally works (pin-to-pin connections correct)
- Visual clarity is the remaining challenge, not electrical correctness
- X1 terminal strip connections visible in wire list CSV, but hard to see on canvas
- Human-AI interpretation gap: code correctness ≠ visual usability
- Next session: focus on wire routing separation OR move to pan/zoom first

### Session 4 - 2026-01-27 (Wire Routing Algorithm)
**Duration**: ~3 hours
**Completed**:
- ✅ **Implemented professional wire routing algorithm** (3-stage approach from academic paper)
  - Stage 1: Orthogonal visibility graph builder (around obstacles)
  - Stage 2: A* pathfinding through visibility graph (shortest paths)
  - Stage 3: Nudging algorithm to separate overlapping segments
- ✅ **Core routing module** (`packages/core-engine/src/routing/`)
  - `visibility-graph.ts`: Builds orthogonal routing grid with obstacle avoidance
  - `astar.ts`: A* pathfinding with Manhattan distance heuristic
  - `orthogonal-router.ts`: Main router combining visibility graph + A*
  - `nudging.ts`: Wire separation algorithm (detects overlaps, assigns offsets)
- ✅ **Fixed critical bugs**:
  - Pins on device edges weren't connecting to graph (fixed with zero-padding for start/end)
  - Nudging created diagonal segments (fixed with orthogonal reconnection)
  - All 11 wires now successfully route with proper separation
- ✅ **Pan/zoom controls** added:
  - Mouse wheel zoom (0.1x - 5x range)
  - Click-drag panning
  - Cursor changes (grab/grabbing)
- ✅ **Debug mode toggle**: Labels now default to OFF for clean screenshots
- ✅ **Wire separation working**: 9 overlap bundles detected and separated (up to 5 wires in one bundle)
- ✅ **Wire color coding**: 11 unique colors for easy wire identification
- ✅ **Routing debugging**: Analyzed W001 jog issue - determined it's due to waypoint grid constraints (optimal point inside obstacle)
- ✅ **Console logging cleanup**: Removed all debug logs to reduce token usage

**Progress**:
- Phase 2: 🟡 60% Complete (routing foundation solid, ready for editor tools)

**Next Session**:
- Improve symbol shapes (actual schematic symbols)
- Fine-tune routing (spacing adjustments, path simplification)
- Start symbol placement tool

**Blockers/Questions**: None - routing foundation is solid!

**Session End Notes**:
- Major milestone: Professional routing algorithm working end-to-end
- Wire separation at X1 terminal clearly visible (5 wires properly offset)
- All routing is orthogonal (90-degree angles only)
- Obstacle avoidance working correctly
- Foundation is ready for interactive editing features
- Research-backed approach (Wybrow, Marriott, Stuckey 2009 paper + libavoid C++ implementation)
- **Routing aesthetic note**: Some wires have visible jogs (e.g., W001 goes down → left → down instead of straight down then left). This happens when optimal waypoints are inside obstacles. Connections are electrically correct - just not maximally straight. Acceptable for now to avoid complex post-processing.

### Session 4 (continued) - 2026-01-27 (Debugging & Skills)
**Duration**: ~1.5 hours
**Completed**:
- ✅ **Deep dive into W001 jog issue**:
  - Added visibility graph debug logging to understand waypoint grid
  - Identified missing waypoint at (60, 100) - inside PS1 obstacle bounds
  - Tested A* heuristic improvements (alignment bias, major axis preference)
  - Reverted heuristic changes - broke other wire connections
  - Conclusion: Jog is due to grid constraints, electrically correct, acceptable for now
- ✅ **Console logging cleanup**:
  - Removed all debug console.log statements from routing code
  - Cleaned visibility-graph.ts, astar.ts, orthogonal-router.ts
  - Reduced token usage for future sessions
- ✅ **Created 4 custom skills** (in ~/.claude/skills/):
  - `cleanup-console`: Automate debug log removal after debugging
  - `session-start`: Load STATUS.md context at session start
  - `update-status`: Update STATUS.md at session end
  - `check-architecture`: Validate changes against architecture principles
- ✅ **Documented terminal block automation feature**:
  - Added to STATUS.md "High Priority Automation Features"
  - Key workflow: Auto-calculate terminal block quantities from terminal count + block type
  - Marked as high priority for Phase 3-4

**Progress**:
- Phase 2: 🟡 60% Complete (routing solid, skills ready for workflow)

**Next Session**:
- Test new skills (especially /session-start at beginning)
- Improve symbol shapes (actual schematic symbols)
- Or start symbol placement tool

**Blockers/Questions**: None

**Session End Notes**:
- Routing algorithm proven to be working correctly
- Decision: Accept aesthetic jogs rather than add post-processing complexity
- Skills will improve session efficiency (faster context loading, easier cleanup)
- Terminal block automation documented as critical automation-first feature

### Session 4 (continued) - 2026-01-27 (Symbol Improvement - IN PROGRESS)
**Duration**: ~30 minutes
**Completed**:
- ✅ **Documented terminal block automation** and **panel layout editor** as high-priority features

  - Found GitHub library (chille/electricalsymbols) with 33 symbols
  - Coded new symbol drawing functions for contactor, button, overload, terminal, power supply
  - User feedback: Motor symbol OK, others "funky and not right"
  - Status: PAUSED mid-task, needs proper IEC symbol reference

**Progress**:
- Phase 2: 🟡 60% Complete (symbols work in progress)

**Next Session**:
- Continue symbol improvement with proper IEC 60617 references
- Redraw contactor, pushbutton, overload, terminal, power supply symbols correctly

- GitHub SVG Library: https://github.com/chille/electricalsymbols
- Siemens Symbols: https://symbols.radicasoftware.com/225/iec-symbols

**Blockers/Questions**:
- Need visual reference for proper IEC symbol drawings (not just descriptions)
- May need to examine SVG files from GitHub library or commercial software

**Session End Notes**:
- User needs to leave - saved progress mid-task
- CLAUDE.md created for better session continuity
- Symbol work 50% done - motor OK, others need refinement

### Session 5 - 2026-01-28 (Canvas Interaction Tools)
**Duration**: ~1 hour
**Completed**:
- ✅ **Implemented full canvas interaction system**:
  - Interaction modes: select, place, wire
  - Hit detection for pins (8px radius) and symbols (bounding box)
  - Selection state with visual highlight (dashed cyan border)
  - Wire tool with visual feedback (orange highlight on start pin)
  - Ghost preview for symbol placement (50% opacity)
  - Snap to 20px grid for placement and dragging
- ✅ **Wire tool working**: Click first pin, click second pin = connection created
  - Creates new net and connection automatically
  - Visual feedback shows wire-in-progress state
  - ESC cancels wire in progress
- ✅ **Drag to reposition**: Click and drag any symbol to move it
  - Tracks offset from click point (no jumping)
  - Wires automatically re-route when symbols move
- ✅ **Delete symbols**: Select + Delete/Backspace removes device and its wires
- ✅ **Toolbar UI**: Select/Wire mode buttons + symbol palette in sidebar
- ✅ **Created `/session-end` skill** for end-of-session updates

**Progress**:
- Phase 2: 🟡 85% Complete (interaction tools done, symbols need polish)

**Next Session**:
- **PRIORITY: Persistence** - circuits disappear on refresh, need to save work
  - Decision needed: IndexedDB (local) vs cloud storage vs hybrid
  - Cloud consideration: Allow 1 free project for free users?
  - Cloud will be needed eventually for symbol library (can't live in core forever)
- Add wire nodes/bend points (intermediate points in wires)
- Improve symbol shapes to match IEC 60617

**Files Modified**:
- `apps/web/src/App.tsx` - Major refactor: interaction modes, hit detection, state management
- `apps/web/src/App.css` - Toolbar and status message styles
- `apps/web/src/renderer/circuit-renderer.ts` - Selection highlight, wire preview, ghost symbol
- `~/.claude/skills/session-end/skill.md` - New skill created

- **Wire bend points fully working**: add/drag/delete waypoints all tested and verified
- Hit detection improved to use auto-routing for accurate wire selection
- Orthogonal-only routing enforced - much cleaner schematics
- **Wire reconnection implemented**: drag endpoints to reconnect wires to different pins

### Session 7 - 2026-01-29 (JSON+SVG Symbol Format)
**Duration**: ~45 minutes
**Completed**:
- ✅ **Implemented JSON+SVG symbol format** for declarative symbol definitions:
  - Added `SymbolPath` interface (`d`, `stroke`, `fill`, `strokeWidth`)
  - Added `SymbolText` interface (`content`, `x`, `y`, `fontSize`, `fontWeight`)
  - Added optional `paths` and `texts` arrays to `SymbolDefinition`
- ✅ **Created SVG path parser** in `symbols.ts`:
  - `parseSVGPath()` - parses M, L, H, V, A, C, Q, Z commands (uppercase/lowercase)
  - `renderPathCommands()` - converts parsed commands to Canvas API
  - `svgArcToCanvasArc()` - converts SVG arc parameters to Canvas arc
  - `renderPaths()` and `renderTexts()` - render to canvas
- ✅ **Updated `drawSymbol()`** to use paths when available:
  - Priority: paths array → custom draw function → generic rectangle
  - Backward compatible (custom draw functions still work as fallback)
- ✅ **Converted all 6 IEC symbols** to JSON+SVG format:
  - Motor: circle + "M" text
  - Button: circle + contact line + actuator
  - Contactor: coil rectangle + contact bars + aux box
  - Overload: rectangle + zigzag thermal element
  - Terminal: rectangle + vertical bars + screw circles
  - Power Supply: rectangle + AC wave + +/- text
- ✅ **Tested in browser**: All symbols render correctly, zoom scales cleanly

**Progress**:
- Phase 2: 🟡 97% Complete (symbols JSON+SVG done, need marquee select)

**Next Session**:
- Add drag-select (marquee/rubber band selection)
- Consider importing symbols from external SVG libraries
- Wire properties panel when wire selected

**Files Modified**:
- `packages/core-model/src/types.ts` - Added SymbolPath, SymbolText interfaces
- `apps/web/src/renderer/symbols.ts` - SVG path parser and renderer
- `packages/core-model/src/symbols/iec-symbols.ts` - Converted all 6 symbols to paths

**Blockers/Questions**: None

**Session End Notes**:
- Major foundation for symbol library: symbols can now be defined as JSON with SVG paths
- Enables future import from external SVG libraries (KiCad, electricalsymbols repo)
- Human-editable symbol definitions - no code changes needed for new symbols
- Foundation for symbol editor UI (users could create/edit symbols visually)
- SVG path parser handles most common commands (M, L, H, V, A, C, Q, Z)
- Arc conversion works for circles; elliptical arcs fall back to lines (rare case)

### Session 8 - 2026-02-05 (Playwright E2E Testing)
**Duration**: ~1.5 hours
**Completed**:
- ✅ **Playwright E2E testing framework** fully set up:
  - Installed `@playwright/test` + Chromium browser binaries

  - `multi-select.spec.ts` (3): Shift+click, Cmd+A, group delete
  - `wire-creation.spec.ts` (3): wire pins, new net, Escape cancel
  - `persistence.spec.ts` (3): auto-save to API, reload persistence, save status
- ✅ **npm scripts** added:
  - `test:e2e` (headless), `test:e2e:headed`, `test:e2e:slow` (500ms delay), `test:e2e:ui`
  - `SLOWMO=<ms>` env var for custom speed

**Key bugs fixed during setup**:
- Auto-fixture needed `{ auto: true }` to run for all tests (not just those requesting `projectId`)
- `page.mouse.click()` doesn't support `modifiers` — used `keyboard.down()/up()` instead
- Save status starts as `'unsaved'` briefly after load — tests wait for initial save cycle

**Files Created**:
- `playwright.config.ts`
- `e2e/global-setup.ts`
- `e2e/helpers/canvas-helpers.ts`
- `e2e/helpers/api-helpers.ts`
- `e2e/fixtures/fusion-cad.fixture.ts`
- `e2e/tests/*.spec.ts` (8 files)

**Files Modified**:
- `apps/web/src/App.tsx` - Added state bridge useEffect
- `package.json` - Added @playwright/test, test scripts
- `.gitignore` - Added Playwright artifacts

**Blockers/Questions**: None

**Session End Notes**:
- Full E2E test coverage for all Phase 2 features
- Tests use isolated ports/database, safe to run alongside dev servers
- SLOWMO support makes it easy for humans to supervise test runs
- Foundation ready for adding more tests as new features land

### Session 9 - 2026-02-06 (Symbol Editor, JSON Symbols, Insert Dialog)
**Duration**: ~2 hours
**Completed**:
- ✅ **Downloaded 126 IEC symbols** from Radica Software stencil 229:
  - Python scripts in `scripts/radica-symbols/` for batch download
  - 55 symbols converted to fusionCad JSON format in `builtin-symbols.json`
- ✅ **JSON-based Symbol Library**:
  - Moved symbols from hardcoded TypeScript to `builtin-symbols.json`
  - Added `tagPrefix` field to SymbolDefinition and JSON (e.g., "PS" for power supply)
  - `symbol-loader.ts` converts JSON to internal SymbolDefinition format
  - `getSymbolById()` added for direct ID lookup (not just category)
  - Renderer's `lookupSymbol()` tries ID first, then category for backward compat
- ✅ **Insert Symbol Dialog** (replaces old sidebar palette):
  - Searchable modal with category filtering
  - SVG preview for each symbol
  - Passes symbol ID (not display category) for correct rendering
- ✅ **Fixed Insert Symbol bug**: Power supply was rendering as contactor
  - Root cause: dialog passed display category "Power" instead of symbol ID
  - Fix: Pass symbol ID through system, renderer looks up by ID first
- ✅ **Wire Preview**: Dashed green line from start pin to cursor during wire creation
  - Fixed: `setMouseWorldPos` now tracks position in wire mode (was only in place mode)
- ✅ **Symbol Editor** (Visual Symbol Builder):
  - Canvas with 5px grid for drawing
  - Tools: Select, Line, Rectangle, Circle, Polyline, Pin
  - Pin properties: name, direction (top/bottom/left/right), type (passive/input/output/power/ground/pe)
  - Symbol properties: name, category, tag prefix, width, height
  - Real-time preview at actual size
  - Save to library (registers with registerSymbol)
  - Edit existing symbols (loads paths and pins)
  - Integrated into Symbol Library with "Create Symbol" and "Edit Symbol" buttons
- ✅ **Discussed licensing model**:
  - Free tier: IndexedDB (local storage), all built-in symbols, no export
  - Pro tier ($19/mo): Postgres cloud sync, PDF/CSV exports, custom symbols

**Progress**:
- Phase 2: 🟢 98% Complete (Symbol Editor done, marquee select still pending)

- Fixed rail-to-device stub wires (L1→first device, last device→L2)
- Added `branchOf` field to Rung type for parallel branch rungs (seal-in circuits)
- Fixed motor starter template: coil on rung 1 only, rung 2 is branch
- Added transform-aware hit-testing for devices, wires, and pins (rotated symbols now selectable)
- Added wire deletion via Delete/Backspace key and toolbar button
- Persisted `transforms` and `rungs` in circuitData across all interfaces

- [x] Motor starter circuit template (3-wire, 8 devices, 3 rungs, 6 wires)
- [x] Transform-aware hit-testing (select/wire/delete on rotated devices)
- [x] Wire deletion (Delete key + toolbar button)
- [x] 35 E2E tests passing

**Still In Progress**:
- [ ] End-to-end MCP test: clean DB → generate motor starter via MCP tools → verify in browser
- [ ] New MCP tools need server restart to be available (restart Claude Code)

### Checkpoint: 2026-02-12 - Linked Device Representations (ID-Keyed Architecture)

**Changes Made**:
- Migrated entire codebase from tag-keyed to ID-keyed device lookups (7-phase plan)
- Added `deviceGroupId` field to Device type for linking representations of same physical device
- New MCP tool: `place_linked_device` (19 tools total now)
- ERC updated: duplicate tag check skips devices sharing same `deviceGroupId`
- BOM updated: linked device groups count as 1 physical item
- All 35 E2E tests passing after migration

**Architecture Updates**:
- Positions: `Map<deviceId, Point>` / `Record<deviceId, {x,y}>` (was tag-keyed)
- Connections: Added `fromDeviceId`/`toDeviceId` fields (tag fields kept for display)
- Selection: `selectedDevices` now contains device IDs (not tags)
- Hit testing: returns device IDs (not tags)

- `packages/mcp-server/src/server.ts` — place_linked_device tool
- `packages/core-engine/src/erc.ts` — deviceGroupId-aware duplicate check
- `packages/reports/src/bom.ts` — linked device group = 1 BOM item

### Checkpoint: 2026-02-12 - Wire Segment Dragging

**Changes Made**:
- Implemented wire segment dragging: click-drag segments on selected wires to move them perpendicular to their direction
- Exported `resolveDevice`, `getPinWorldPosition`, `toOrthogonalPath` from `circuit-renderer.ts`
- Added `replaceWaypoints()` to `useCircuitState.ts` (bulk waypoint replacement without history push)
- Added `computeWirePinPositions()` and `simplifyWaypoints()` helpers to `useCanvasInteraction.ts`

**Completed**:
- [x] Segment detection on mousedown (reuses existing `getWireSegmentAtPoint`)
- [x] Path materialization (orthogonal path → waypoints on drag start)
- [x] Perpendicular drag with grid snapping
- [x] Jog insertion for first/last segments (maintains orthogonal routing from pins)
- [x] Collinear waypoint simplification on mouseup

**Known Issue**:
- ~~🔴 VISIBILITY BUG~~ → **FIXED** in next checkpoint

### Session - 2026-02-25 (Symbol Resolution Pipeline + Parametric Generators)

**Problem**: Parts like Allen-Bradley 1769-PA4 rendered as blank 40x40 boxes because part categories (`plc-ps`, `contactor`) didn't match any symbol ID or display category (`PLC`, `Power`, `Control`).

**Completed**:
- ✅ **Category alias bridge** — 27 aliases mapping part-catalog categories to symbol IDs (e.g., `contactor` → `iec-contactor-3p`, `plc-ps` → `iec-power-supply-ac-dc`)
- ✅ **`registerCategoryAlias()`** in symbol-library.ts — bridges part categories to symbols
- ✅ **`symbolCategory` preference** — All symbol/geometry lookups now try `part.symbolCategory` before `part.category` (fixed in circuit-renderer, useCanvasInteraction, useCircuitState, types.ts)
- ✅ **Parametric symbol generators** — `generatePLCDigitalSymbol(type, channels)` and `generatePLCAnalogSymbol(type, channels)` auto-generate PLC I/O symbols with correct pin counts
- ✅ **4-tier `resolveSymbol()` pipeline** — Exact ID → Category alias → Parametric generation → Smart fallback. Never returns undefined.
- ✅ **Smart generic fallback** — Dashed-border placeholder with category label and 4 generic pins (replaces blank box)
- ✅ **Auto-caching** — Generated symbols register themselves on first use
- ✅ 122 E2E tests passing

**Key results**:
- `plc-di-16` → 17-pin symbol (COM + DI0-DI15) — all channels wirable
- `plc-do-32` → auto-generates 33-pin symbol on the fly
- Unknown categories get labeled placeholders instead of blank boxes
- Allen-Bradley 1769-PA4 now renders as power supply symbol (50x60, 4 pins)
- ✅ **Part number labels on canvas** — Part number (e.g., "1769-IF8") renders below symbol, tag renders above. Theme-aware styling across all 6 presets. Only shown when part is assigned.

**Files Created**: `packages/core-model/src/symbols/symbol-generators.ts`
**Files Modified**: `symbol-library.ts`, `iec-symbols.ts`, `circuit-renderer.ts`, `symbols.ts`, `useCanvasInteraction.ts`, `useCircuitState.ts`, `types.ts`, `index.ts`, `theme.ts`

**Next priority**: ERC hot-to-neutral short circuit detection (added to High Priority features)

### Session 11 - 2026-02-28 (Cloud Deployment + ERC Short Circuit + Google/GitHub OAuth)
**Duration**: ~3 hours (planning + implementation across 2 context windows)
**Completed**:
- Implemented all 3 planned items from storage architecture rethink:

  2. **ERC Hot-to-Neutral Short Circuit** — Device classifier, circuit graph builder, BFS path analysis
  3. **Google/GitHub OAuth** — Amplify config, useAuth methods, AuthModal buttons

**Architecture Updates**:
- `apps/api/src/data-source.ts` — Supports `DATABASE_URL` env var, disables `synchronize` in production, adds SSL for managed Postgres
- `apps/api/src/index.ts` — CORS restricted via `CORS_ORIGINS` env var, `/health` verifies DB connection
- `packages/core-engine/src/device-classifier.ts` (new) — Classifies devices as load/protection/switching/passive/source/unknown by symbol keyword, part category, or tag prefix
- `packages/core-engine/src/circuit-graph.ts` (new) — Builds adjacency map from connections, BFS path finder between power rails
- `packages/core-engine/src/erc.ts` — New `checkHotToNeutralShort()` rule: identifies hot/neutral nets, finds paths, flags paths with no load AND no protection
- `apps/web/src/auth/amplify-config.ts` — Reads `VITE_COGNITO_OAUTH_DOMAIN`, adds OAuth config to Amplify when present
- `apps/web/src/auth/useAuth.ts` — `loginWithGoogle`/`loginWithGitHub` via `signInWithRedirect`, Hub listener for OAuth callbacks
- `apps/web/src/components/AuthModal.tsx` — OAuth buttons (Google/GitHub) with SVG icons, only shown when `oauthEnabled`

**Files Created**:
- `Dockerfile` — Multi-stage build (builder + node:20-alpine runtime)
- `.dockerignore` — Excludes node_modules, .git, e2e, .claude
- `.env.example` — Documents all env vars (DB, CORS, Auth, AI, OAuth)
- `apps/api/src/migrations/1709000000000-InitialSchema.ts` — Baseline migration
- `railway.json` — Railway deployment config
- `e2e/tests/health.spec.ts` — Health endpoint E2E test
- `e2e/tests/auth.spec.ts` — OAuth button visibility + modal open/close E2E tests
- `packages/core-engine/src/device-classifier.ts` — Device role classification
- `packages/core-engine/src/circuit-graph.ts` — Circuit graph building + path analysis
- `packages/core-engine/src/device-classifier.test.ts` — 32 unit tests
- `packages/core-engine/src/circuit-graph.test.ts` — 7 unit tests
- `packages/core-engine/src/erc-short-circuit.test.ts` — 6 integration tests
- `packages/core-engine/vitest.config.ts` — Vitest config for core-engine

**Files Modified**:
- `apps/api/src/data-source.ts` — DATABASE_URL, SSL, synchronize:false in prod
- `apps/api/src/index.ts` — CORS_ORIGINS, enhanced /health
- `apps/api/package.json` — Migration scripts
- `packages/core-engine/src/erc.ts` — Added checkHotToNeutralShort rule
- `packages/core-engine/src/index.ts` — Exported new modules
- `packages/core-engine/package.json` — Added vitest + test scripts
- `apps/web/src/auth/amplify-config.ts` — OAuth config + isOAuthEnabled()
- `apps/web/src/auth/useAuth.ts` — OAuth methods + Hub listener
- `apps/web/src/components/AuthModal.tsx` — OAuth buttons UI
- `apps/web/src/App.css` — OAuth button styles

**Test Results**:
- 125 E2E tests passing (2 new auth + 1 health + existing 122)
- 45 core-engine unit tests passing (32 device-classifier + 7 circuit-graph + 6 ERC integration)

**Blockers/Questions**: None

**Next Session**:
1. Deploy API to cloud (Railway/Fly.io + managed Postgres)
2. Configure Cognito OAuth providers in AWS Console
3. Gate AI features behind auth
4. Improve selector switch symbol visuals

**Session End Notes**:
- All code is committed and pushed to origin/main
- Dockerfile builds but hasn't been deployed yet — needs cloud provider setup
- OAuth UI is ready but dormant until VITE_COGNITO_OAUTH_DOMAIN is set in env
- ERC short circuit detection is conservative: unknown device roles don't trigger false positives
- Root-level `npx tsc --noEmit` has pre-existing errors (TypeORM decorators, JSX flags) — use per-package tsconfigs instead

---

### Checkpoint: 2026-02-13 - Visibility Bug Fix + Canvas Panning

**Changes Made**:
- Fixed visibility bug: RAF coalescing in Canvas.tsx had `needsRenderRef` boolean stuck at `true`
  - Root cause: `cancelAnimationFrame` in effect cleanup cancelled pending RAF before it could reset the flag
  - Fix: Replaced with cancel-and-reschedule pattern — each effect run cancels pending RAF and schedules new one
  - Bonus: Canvas buffer only resets on actual container resize (uses `clearRect` otherwise)
- Implemented canvas panning:
  - Click+drag on empty space = pan (was always marquee, making pan impossible)
  - Space+drag = pan from anywhere (even over devices)
  - Middle-mouse-button drag = pan from anywhere
  - Shift+drag on empty space = marquee selection (was the old default)
- Removed dead pan code that was unreachable (line 628-661 in old useCanvasInteraction.ts)

**Files Modified**:
- `apps/web/src/components/Canvas.tsx` — Fixed RAF rendering, buffer optimization
- `apps/web/src/hooks/useCanvasInteraction.ts` — Added panning (3 methods), changed marquee to Shift+drag
- `e2e/helpers/canvas-helpers.ts` — Updated dragMarquee to hold Shift automatically

**Debugging Process** (documented for future reference):
1. Browser screenshot showed empty canvas despite "19 devices · 24 wires" in header
2. JS eval showed canvas buffer stuck at 300x150 (HTML default) while CSS stretched to 1270x682
3. Manual `fillRect` test proved canvas element worked — rendering code never executed
4. React fiber inspection found `needsRenderRef.current === true` (stuck!)
5. Traced to `cancelAnimationFrame` in cleanup cancelling the RAF that would have reset the flag
6. Reverted to direct render approach, then re-added RAF with safe cancel-and-reschedule pattern

## 🚨 Known Issues / Blockers

**No persistence (HIGH PRIORITY):**
- Circuits disappear on page refresh - all work lost
- Need to implement save/load before users can actually use the app
- Decision pending: storage strategy (see Ideas section below)

**Routing aesthetics (low priority):**
- Some wires have unnecessary-looking jogs where they turn, continue briefly, then turn back (e.g., W001 has down→left→down pattern)
- Root cause: Optimal direct waypoints sometimes fall inside obstacle bounds, forcing detours through available grid points
- All connections are electrically correct and reach their terminals
- Decision: Acceptable for now. Post-processing to straighten paths would add complexity without functional benefit
- Future: Could be addressed with smarter waypoint placement or path smoothing algorithm

## 💡 Ideas / Future Considerations

### High Priority Automation Features

**ERC: Hot-to-Neutral Short Circuit Detection** ⭐⭐ (NEXT PRIORITY)
- Fundamental electrical safety rule: never connect hot to neutral/return without a load
- L1 → N = short circuit (ERROR)
- L1 → breaker → N = still a short (breaker is protection, not a load) (ERROR)
- L1 → breaker → motor → N = valid (motor is a load) (OK)
- **Implementation plan:**
  1. Build net reachability graph (BFS/Union-Find through connections)
  2. Classify device categories: `load` (motor, coil, heater, resistor, light), `protection` (breaker, fuse, disconnect), `switching` (contact, relay)
  3. New ERC rule: if two power rails of different potential are connected through a path with no load device → error
- **Infrastructure needed:** Multi-device path tracing (current ERC only checks single devices)
- **Data available:** Pin types (power, input, output), net types (power, signal, ground), ladder rail labels (L1/L2), part categories
- **Key files:** `packages/core-engine/src/erc.ts`, `packages/core-model/src/types.ts`
- User priority: CRITICAL — this is the most basic electrician rule

**Automatic Terminal Block Calculation** ⭐ (Phase 3-4)
- When you specify terminals in your design (e.g., 20 terminals on a PLC breakout)
- And specify the terminal block type (e.g., Phoenix PT-2.5 with 5 positions per block)
- BOM should automatically calculate quantity needed (e.g., 4 blocks for 20 terminals)
- This is core to "automation-first" - no manual counting/calculation
- Related: Terminal strip layout generation, wire number assignment per terminal
- User priority: HIGH - critical for real electrical work

**Panel Layout Editor** ⭐ (Phase 6-7)
- Physical arrangement of components in enclosure (different from schematic)
- DIN rail layout with proper spacing
- 3D wire routing and cable management
- Wire duct placement and sizing
- Auto-generate panel cutout drawings
- User priority: HIGH - essential for real electrical work

### Storage Strategy ✅ IMPLEMENTED (2026-01-29)

**Decision:** Postgres + TypeORM with REST API

**What's working:**
- Docker Postgres on port 5433
- Express API server (apps/api) on port 3001
- Auto-save with 1-second debounce
- Project management (create, rename, delete, switch)
- Circuit data stored as JSONB (devices, nets, parts, connections, positions)

**Future considerations:**
- Cloud deployment (user accounts, 1 free project limit)
- Symbol library in cloud (too big for core bundle)
- Offline support with sync

### Symbol Library Strategy (Phase 4+)

**Sources identified:**
- [chille/electricalsymbols](https://github.com/chille/electricalsymbols) - 33 IEC 60617 symbols, MIT license
- [upb-lea/Inkscape_electric_Symbols](https://github.com/upb-lea/Inkscape_electric_Symbols) - 100+ symbols, MIT
- [KiCAD Official](https://kicad.github.io/symbols/) - 1000+ components, CC-BY-SA/CC0

**Approach:**
1. Create JSON symbol schema (pins, geometry, metadata)
2. Convert SVG symbols from GitHub libraries
3. Build symbol browser UI
4. Eventually: cloud-hosted symbol registry

### DXF/DWG Import/Export (Phase 6+)

**Libraries identified:**
- **Export (DXF):** [@tarikjabiri/dxf](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@tarikjabiri/dxf) - MIT, pure TypeScript
- **Import (DWG/DXF):** [libredwg-web](https://github.com/mlightcad/libredwg-web) - GPL-2.0, WASM-based

**Priority:**
1. DXF export first (easier, more demand)
2. DXF import second
3. DWG import last (complex format)

### Post-MVP Considerations

- Desktop app (Tauri) - deferred to post-MVP
- ~~Cloud sync - deferred to post-MVP~~ → May need sooner for symbol library
