# 🛑 STOP! READ THIS FIRST! 🛑

## 🧠 ENGINEERING STANDARDS

You are a **senior software developer**. Act accordingly:

- **No hacks.** Write clean, well-reasoned solutions. If a shortcut compromises correctness, maintainability, or clarity, don't take it.
- **Research before guessing.** If you don't know something, look it up — read docs, search the web, read source code. Come back with a solid, informed approach. Don't wing it.
- **Trial-and-error is a last resort.** Only use trial-and-error when there is no good knowledge base available (offline docs, source code, web resources) or the problem is genuinely novel. Otherwise, understand the system first, then act.
- **Understand before changing.** Read the relevant code, understand the architecture, then propose changes. Never modify code you haven't read.
- **Minimal, focused changes.** Only change what's necessary. Don't refactor surroundings, add features that weren't asked for, or "improve" unrelated code.
- **No redundant confirmations.** Once a plan is agreed upon (e.g., "we'll edit files A, B, C"), just do it — don't ask permission for each file edit. Don't ask "is your dev server running?" or other obvious questions. Batch checks at the end, not after every edit.
- **Just fetch and research.** Never ask permission to fetch URLs, web pages, documentation, or research papers. Just do it — it's an obvious part of the workflow.
- **Minimize back-and-forth.** Be concise. Don't narrate every step. Don't summarize what you just did unless the user asks. Act, don't talk about acting.

## 🔴 VERIFICATION — NEVER ASSUME, ALWAYS CHECK

**This is the #1 rule. Violations have repeatedly caused bugs, wasted time, and broken trust.**

- **NEVER say "done" without verification.** After ANY change:
  1. Confirm the change is actually being served (Vite HMR is unreliable — check via `curl` or browser console import)
  2. Run the render audit (`getRenderAudit()`) for visual/rendering changes
  3. Run E2E tests for functional changes
  4. Take a screenshot or read audit data for visual changes
- **Verify at the RIGHT layer.** Theme changes? Check `getTheme()` in browser console. Symbol changes? Check the API response AND the rendered output. Wire changes? Check connection data AND the render audit.
- **Hardcoded values override themes.** Always check symbol primitives, not just theme config. The junction `#00ff00` bug happened because a hardcoded fill in the symbol primitive overrode the theme color.
- **Restart services after rebuilding.** MCP server changes require: `npm run build` → restart API. Symbols auto-sync on startup (upsert, only writes changes). Vite changes may need full restart (HMR doesn't always work for renderer modules).
- **Check BOTH the code AND the running app.** `curl` the served file to verify Vite is serving your changes. `getTheme()` in console to verify theme. `getRenderAudit()` to verify rendering.
- **If you can't verify, say so.** "I made the change but can't confirm it's being served — please reload" is honest. "Done" without checking is not.

## 🛠️ TOOLS FOR VERIFICATION

| What changed | How to verify |
|---|---|
| Theme/colors | `import('/src/renderer/theme.ts').then(m => console.log(m.getTheme().fieldName))` |
| Symbol data | `curl -s http://localhost:3001/api/symbols/SYMBOL_ID` |
| Rendering | `window.__fusionCadState.getRenderAudit()` in browser console |
| Wire routing | Check audit: `audit.wires.map(w => w.pathType + ' ' + w.isHorizontal)` |
| Device positions | Check audit: `audit.devices.map(d => d.tag + ': ' + JSON.stringify(d.bounds))` |
| Overlaps | Check audit: `audit.overlaps` |
| Unconnected | Check audit: `audit.stats.unconnectedDevices` |
| Vite serving changes | `curl -s http://localhost:5173/src/path/to/file.ts \| grep "UNIQUE_STRING"` |

## 🚢 PORT ASSIGNMENTS (DO NOT CONFLICT)

fusionCad uses these specific ports. Never kill other vite/api processes:

| Service | Dev Port | Test Port | Description |
|---------|----------|-----------|-------------|
| API     | 3001     | 3003      | Express API server |
| Vite    | 5173     | 5174      | Vite dev server |

When running tests, servers on ports 3003/5174 are used. If you need to kill a stuck test server:
```bash
lsof -ti:3003,5174 | xargs kill 2>/dev/null
```

---

## SESSION START CHECKLIST

**IMPORTANT: Start Claude Code with `claude --chrome` for this project.** fusionCad is a visual canvas-based tool — browser inspection is essential for debugging rendering, wire routing, and layout issues.

Before doing ANYTHING else:

1. **Read this file** — priorities, bugs, and context are all here. This is the single source of truth.
2. **Connect to Chrome** — use `tabs_context_mcp` to see the running app. Take a screenshot to verify state.
3. **Present P0 items first** when summarizing what's next. Never bury critical bugs below feature work.
4. **Ask user what they want to work on today.**

---

## 🔴 PRIORITIES — Single Source of Truth

**Current phase:** Phase 2 — Minimal Editor (99% complete)
**Branch:** `main`
**Last session:** 38-40 (2026-04-07 to 2026-04-12) — BOM editor, auto pin aliases, title block, selection fix, tests, first real project shipped (MOWI compressor sequencer)
**Tests:** 136 E2E + 105 unit, 89 symbols + 10 PLC generators
**Coordinate system:** All internal coordinates are **millimeters (mm)**. M=2.5mm (IEC 60617), grid=5mm, MM_TO_PX=4. See `packages/core-model/src/units.ts`. Symbols converted to mm in Session 30 (v3.0-mm).

### P0 — Launch Blockers

1. **Page thumbnails** — Sheet navigation with thumbnail previews. Core UX for multi-sheet projects.
2. **Movable text labels** — Drag tag, description, pin labels to reposition per device. Fixes text/wire overlap.
3. **Device linking UI** — Select multiple devices → "Link as same part" for multi-symbol parts (PLC DI+DO+layout = one BOM item).
4. **Smart AI defaults** — "16 relays" → full project with power, PLC, sheets, contacts, terminals.

**Motor-starter hook reliability** — The Motor Starter Calculator depends on a bulletproof end-to-end generation. Current flow uses AI parsing which is probabilistic. **Fix with a deterministic endpoint**: `POST /api/projects/:id/generate-motor-starter` takes structured `{hp, voltage, phase, starterType, controlVoltage, eStop, hoaSwitch, pilotLight, plcRemote}` and calls `generateMotorStarterPanel` directly (bypasses AI parser). Calculator URL changes from `?prompt=<natural>` to `?motorStarter=<base64-json-spec>`. Benefits: deterministic, free (no AI rate limit), same auth posture (requireAuth). Also needed: verify generated panel includes a **layout sheet** with the panel footprints (DIN rail + contactor/breaker/overload footprints placed) — currently only schematic. Add `generate_motor_starter_panel` MCP tool is separate from single-sheet generator — make sure the deterministic endpoint produces BOTH schematic + layout sheets so the calculator-funneled user sees a complete deliverable.
5. **Post-generation ERC + auto-fix** — Run ERC after AI finishes, feed violations back (max 3 retries). AI quality gate.
6. **Auth enforced on AI endpoints** — AI chat uses `optionalAuth`, needs `requireAuth` for paid features. Can't launch open.
7. **AI chat rate limiting** — `/api/ai-chat` has NO rate limiting or usage tracking. Can't launch without this.
8. **AWS-readiness auth hardening** — MANDATORY before AWS deploy. Cognito + Amplify are wired (`requireAuth` on all project endpoints, Google/GitHub OAuth, email/password). Gaps to close: (a) `requireAuth` on `/api/ai-generate`, `/api/symbols/ai-generate`, `/api/symbols/ai-import-assist`, `/api/ai-chat` — see `apps/api/src/index.ts:507-600`; (b) rate limit + usage tracking on `/api/ai-chat`; (c) audit `optionalAuth` uses across all routes; (d) enforce plan tiers (free: 3 projects, no AI / paid: unlimited + AI); (e) lock CORS to known origins; (f) verify Cognito token validation in Lambda environment. Do NOT deploy to AWS until all 6 are complete.

### P1 — Core Quality (ship soon after launch)

1. **Node-based electrical graph** — Implement the planned `Node` entity from core-model. Replace junction-as-device with proper graph nodes. Enables: net-level wire defaults, proper electrical analysis, cleaner junction handling, wire annotation propagation per net. **⚠️ Architectural change — use feature branch `feature/node-graph`, merge after testing.**
2. **Smart alignment guides (Figma-style)** — Lightweight alternative to a formal column entity. On drag, detect other devices within ±2mm of the pointer's X (or Y), show a guideline, and snap to the shared coordinate. Three+ devices sharing an X becomes a stronger "established lane." No data model change, no new entity, no migration. Rationale from compressor case study: columns already emerge from bulk generators (K1–K11 at x=110, X7–X28 at x=250/335) — the problem is only that manual drags break alignment by sub-mm amounts. Smart guides preserve emergent alignment with zero blast radius. Works on all sheet types (no match = no snap). Reversible via toggle. If this proves insufficient, revisit a formal `Column` entity later.
3. **Wiring UX + smart wires** — Current routing produces spaghetti on bus-wire patterns (see `memory/project_wiring_architecture.md`). Needs: better interactive drawing (rubber-band preview, snap-to-pin, auto-junction on cross), smarter routing (bus entity OR KiCad-style segments), net-level properties (gauge/color/number propagate along the net), and wire numbering auto-generated from rung + column index. ⚠️ **Human-in-the-loop required** — wiring UX is the core daily interaction, must be co-designed with the user, not AI-generated.
4. **Multi-symbol part linking** — Parts like PLCs need multiple symbols (DI+DO+CPU) linked by `deviceGroupId`. Completeness checking, BOM grouping.
5. **DXF rendering quality** — Text garbled (font/size/alignment), fills missing, line weights. Research proper DXF text rendering + HATCH/SOLID fill support.
6. **Rich AI circuit context** — Show AI which pins are connected vs unconnected. Move context building server-side.
7. **Print/PDF paper size verification** — Test all paper sizes (A4, A3, Letter, Tabloid, ANSI-D) with mm coordinates.
8. **Layout built-in symbols** — Promote imported layout footprints (PLC, relays, power supplies) to built-in library.
8b. **Hoffman (or equivalent) enclosure catalog** — Motor starter generator places `panel-enclosure-*` and `panel-subpanel-*` layout symbols with descriptions like `Enclosure 24x20x8" (Hoffman)`. These are the last 2 BOM placeholders after the operator-parts fix (Session 42). Add `packages/core-model/src/parts/hoffman.ts` with A-series enclosures keyed by size so `generateMotorStarterPanel` can assign PNL1/SP1. Closes the "complete BOM from calculator" gap.
9. **AI-assisted symbol creation** — ✅ AI-assisted import built (Session 36). **TODO:** Tune layout prompt, add MCP `create_custom_symbol` tool, load symbol-creation-rules.md into AI chat context.
10. **Error monitoring** — Sentry or similar for production error tracking.

### P2 — Infrastructure & Optimization

1. **AWS deployment** — Amplify (frontend), API Gateway + Lambda (backend), CDK with Lambda layers, RDS Postgres. CI/CD with GitHub Actions. Auto-rollback if E2E tests fail.
2. **S3 image + file storage** — Currently images are base64 data URLs in `Annotation.style.imageData` and `Sheet.titleBlock.logoData` — inline in circuit JSON. At scale this bloats DB rows and every save/load. Plan: bucket `fusioncad-user-uploads` keyed `{userId}/{projectId}/{uuid}.{ext}`, CloudFront CDN in front. Backend endpoint `/api/files/upload-url` returns a presigned PUT URL, client uploads directly to S3 (bypasses API bandwidth). DB stores `{ s3Key, mimeType, widthMm, heightMm }` instead of base64. Logos: public CloudFront URLs. Panel photos: signed URLs (private). Write a one-time migration script to move existing base64 images to S3 before AWS production launch.
2. **Template caching** — Cache common AI patterns to skip generation entirely.
3. **CDN for static assets** — CloudFront for the web app.
4. **CORS locked down** — Currently allows all origins in dev.
5. ~~**Database backups automated**~~ ✅ (Session 40) — Hourly launchd job, tiered retention. `./scripts/install-backup-cron.sh`
6. **Project backup/restore verified** — Export/import .fcad.json tested end-to-end.
7. **Symbol/part persistence review** — Imported symbols use API when online, localStorage fallback offline. Review for production: user symbol storage, DB migration, multi-tenant isolation.
8. **Symbol source-of-truth unification** — Three symbol sources (generated in-memory, DB, localStorage) can conflict. Generated PLC symbols now auto-seed on startup ✅ (Session 35). localStorage should be an offline queue that syncs to DB.

### P3 — Business & Revenue

1. **Stripe/payment integration** — Connect billing to plan tiers.
2. **Usage dashboard** — Show users their AI generation count, remaining quota.
3. **AI model tiering** — Cheaper models for simple edits, Sonnet for generation.
4. **AI cost tracking** — Log token usage per request.

### P4 — Analytics & Growth

1. **Split marketing/tools into separate workspace** — `apps/marketing/` for landing pages + public tools (Motor Starter Calculator, future Wire Sizer, Voltage Drop, Conduit Fill, Enclosure Sizer). Own bundle, own Amplify config entry, own routing. Benefits: smaller public-site bundle (no editor SDK), independent deploy cadence, different auth posture (none), SEO-first (consider Next.js/Astro for SSR later). Current location (inside `apps/web/src/tools/`) is fine for MVP but refactor when the second tool lands. Owner: fusionLogik.
2. **Motor Starter Calculator (public lead-gen tool)** — A polished standalone page at `/tools/motor-starter-calculator` (no auth). User inputs: HP/kW, voltage, phase, duty/category, start type (DOL/soft/VFD). Reuses `motor-database.json` + `schneider-motor-catalog.ts` to output recommended contactor + overload + breaker with datasheet links. Primary CTA: "Open in fusionCad" → signs up the user + auto-creates a project with `generate_motor_starter` pre-populated. Secondary: CSV/PDF export of the BOM. Goal: top-of-funnel SEO hook for electrical engineers + frictionless conversion to signup. Nice UI = no DIY engineering dashboard — polished marketing-grade.
2. **Analytics** — Usage patterns, feature tracking, generation success rate.

### Future Phases (Post-Launch)

- **Symbol creation/verification tool** — Reliable symbol building + validation
- **Automatic terminal block calculation** — Phase 3-4
- **Panel layout editor** — Physical layout editor, Phase 6-7
- **Multi-tenancy** — org_id, team features
- **Blueprint editor UI** — Visual blueprint creation/editing
- **gstack integration** — Parallel sprint workflow with Conductor for multi-agent development

## 🤖 MCP SERVER

The MCP server (`packages/mcp-server/`) exposes circuit operations as tools for AI agents.

**To use:** Start the API (`npm run dev:api`), then restart Claude Code — it discovers `.mcp.json` automatically.

**30 Tools:** `list_projects`, `get_project_summary`, `list_devices`, `list_connections`, `list_symbols`, `search_symbols`, `run_erc`, `generate_bom`, `list_parts_catalog`, `create_project`, `place_device`, `place_linked_device`, `delete_device`, `update_device`, `create_wire`, `delete_wire`, `assign_part`, `add_sheet`, `add_annotation`, `create_ladder_block`, `list_blocks`, `delete_block`, `set_sheet_type` _(deprecated)_, `add_rung`, `auto_layout_ladder`, `generate_motor_starter`, `generate_motor_starter_panel`, `add_control_rung`, `lookup_motor_starter`, `generate_motor_starter_from_spec`

**Key files:**
- `packages/mcp-server/src/server.ts` - Tool registrations
- `packages/mcp-server/src/circuit-helpers.ts` - Pure circuit mutation functions
- `packages/mcp-server/src/circuit-templates.ts` - Motor starter + control rung generators
- `packages/mcp-server/src/api-client.ts` - HTTP client for fusionCad API
- `packages/core-model/src/motor-data/lookup.ts` - Motor starter component lookup
- `packages/core-model/src/motor-data/motor-database.json` - 216 Schneider Electric motor configs
- `packages/core-model/src/parts/schneider-motor-catalog.ts` - 289 motor-power parts (contactors, breakers, overloads) with datasheet URLs
- `packages/core-model/src/parts/schneider-pushbuttons.ts` - Harmony XB4/XB5 operator parts: pushbuttons (`pushbutton`), E-stops (`e-stop`), pilot lights (`pilot-light`), selector switches (`selector-switch`). Also exports `getMotorStarterOperatorParts(controlVoltage)` returning canonical parts for start button, stop button, E-stop, HOA selector, pilot light. **Use this before inventing part numbers.**
- `packages/core-model/src/parts/schneider-electric.ts` - Other Schneider general parts
- `packages/core-model/src/parts/index.ts` - `ALL_MANUFACTURER_PARTS` + `getPartsByCategory(category)` + `getPartsByManufacturer(mfr)` helpers
- `.mcp.json` - Claude Code auto-discovery config

## 🧪 E2E TESTING (Playwright)

135 E2E + 45 unit tests. Separate ports (API 3003, Vite 5174) and test database (`fusion_cad_test`).

```bash
npm run db:up              # ensure Docker Postgres is running
npm run test:e2e           # headless (fast)
npm run test:e2e:headed    # watch in browser
npm run test:e2e:slow      # headed + 500ms delay
npm run test:e2e:ui        # Playwright UI mode
```

**Key files:**
- `playwright.config.ts` - config, webServer, ports
- `e2e/fixtures/fusion-cad.fixture.ts` - auto-fixture (clean project per test)
- `e2e/helpers/canvas-helpers.ts` - worldToScreen, placeSymbol, createWire
- `e2e/helpers/api-helpers.ts` - deleteAllProjects, createEmptyProject
- `apps/web/src/App.tsx` - state bridge (`window.__fusionCadState`, dev-only)
- `apps/web/src/components/BomEditor.tsx` - BOM editor dialog (Tools menu)
- `apps/web/src/utils/pin-math.ts` - Pure math for pin transforms (testable)
- `apps/web/src/renderer/title-block.ts` - Title block renderer (proprietary notice, logo, fields)
- `packages/reports/src/bom.ts` - BOM generator with overrides support
- `packages/core-model/src/parts/allen-bradley.ts` - Parts catalog with pinMappings
- `scripts/backup-db.sh` - DB backup with tiered retention
- `scripts/install-backup-cron.sh` - Hourly launchd backup job installer

**Gotchas:**
- `page.mouse.click()` doesn't support `modifiers` — use `keyboard.down()/up()`
- Vite needs `--strictPort` to prevent silent port fallback
- Save status starts as `'unsaved'` briefly after load (auto-save cycle)

---

## 🌐 BROWSER TESTING (Optional)

- Start session with `claude --chrome` to enable browser integration
- Or run `/chrome` within an existing session to connect
- Useful for: testing canvas rendering, debugging console errors, recording demo GIFs

---

## 🚨 BEFORE COMMITTING - MANDATORY

```bash
# 1. TypeScript check (no emit)
npx tsc --noEmit

# 2. E2E tests (requires Docker: npm run db:up)
npm run test:e2e

# 3. If API changes were made, also run API tests
```

- Fix failing tests BEFORE committing
- Update test expectations if UI/behavior intentionally changed
- Never commit with failing tests

## 🔐 SECURITY POSTURE

**Dependency audit:** Run `npm audit --omit=dev` weekly and before any production deploy. Production deps should always be at **0 vulnerabilities**. Dev-only tooling vulns (vite/vitest/esbuild chain) are acceptable but track in STATUS.md.

**Known-clean supply chain (as of 2026-04-14):**
- No `axios` (uses native `fetch` instead — avoids the axios supply-chain concern class)
- No historically-compromised packages (`event-stream`, `ua-parser-js`, `node-ipc`, `colors.js`, `flatmap-stream`, etc.)
- `nanoid@3.3.11` — clean version

**Before adding a new dependency:**
1. Check it's still actively maintained (recent commits, not a single-maintainer orphan)
2. `npm view <pkg>` to see maintainers + download count
3. Prefer native `fetch`, `crypto`, `URL`, `URLSearchParams` over wrappers
4. Run `npm audit` after install — if new high-severity findings appear, re-evaluate

**Auth posture** (shipped Session 41):
- All AI endpoints require `requireAuth` + `checkAiRateLimit`
- Symbol mutation endpoints (PUT/DELETE /api/symbols/:id, POST /api/symbols/seed) require auth
- `/health` and GET /api/symbols/* are intentionally public
- CORS: configurable via `CORS_ORIGINS` env (locked down in production)

## 📚 KEY DOCUMENTS

- **STATUS.md** - Session log archive (sessions 1-22)
- **ARCHITECTURE_v0.6.md** - System architecture, multi-tenancy, design principles

## 💡 REMEMBER

- **Automation-first** - fusionCad is for electrical engineers, focus on real workflow automation
- **Local-first** - No server required for core editing
- **Terminal blocks matter** - Auto-calculating terminal block quantities is HIGH priority (future phase)
- **Panel layout is coming** - Physical layout editor is a confirmed future feature
